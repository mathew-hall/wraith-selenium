#set the devices you want to run each browser in your suite on here.

#thereby allowing you test different browser versions or platforms

#base type - either 'browser' or 'url'.
#browser base type will compare a given url using a browser as a base.
#url base type will use a url as the basis for comparison against a second url
base_type: browser

#set this if you are using browser type based comparison.
#With URL-based comparison this parameter will be ignored.
base_browser: firefox

#set this flag to true if using browser based comparison and you wish to compare
#the base browser image to a shot of the refreshed page url using the same base browser.
#This can be useful to check for page differences caused by loading or other instabilities,
#but first check that caching in the base browser has been entirely disabled.

#very annoyingly and weirdly, selenium often interprets screenshot sizes differently from those
#stipulated in your window dimensions. Offset behaviour seems inconsistent between browsers,
#browser versions and between different widths.
#Your first run using selenium using browser-based comparison may well result in some
#invalid diff comparisons due to screen shot width variation.
#To rectify this, inspect the screenshot widths produced against your configured widths,
#You can then add a bias value for each browser screen width as shown below.
